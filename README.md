# Frontend Coding Exercise!

This is a quick frontend coding challenge. It's important to note that it's by no means a test...we just want to get a sense for how you write code and solve problems.

We have a simple API that returns a JSON array. We would like you to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to read the API and display it in an organized way. In addition, you should add in some sort of sorting mechanic to the front-end. Feel free to use any frameworks you would like to achieve the task.

Ideally the design should be responsive and meet accessibility requirements.

The API has a single GET endpoint at the following url:
